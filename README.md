# Plant Splicer
Mix and match plant genetics to create beautiful images!

# Tips
- Press the Escape key to go back to the Main Menu
- The Editor closes with the Main render window
- In the Editor Window, Press Control+S to save, Control+O to open, and Control+P to splice (splicing requires paths are provided in editor)
- When splicing, try to use plants that make use of a similar number of genomes
- Use more genomes
- Try to avoid negative colour change values, can lead to strange colours when splicing
- Avoid making direction spread too high
- Splicing keeps genes from each plant randomly, which means you get a different result from splicing every time
- Press "S" to take a screenshot (in the Main render window)
- Splice already been spliced plants together!
- Enter filenames exactly as they are written![image](https://github.com/Wurnace/plant_splicer/assets/122387227/2d19391d-eb8d-4c15-a21f-e169a02487fa)
