# Plant Splicer
Mix and match plant genetics to create beautiful images!

# Tips
- Press the escape key to go back to menu
- The editor closes with the main render window
- Press W to save, L to load, and P to save (if a paths are provided in editor)
- Rename .genome files when they are created
- When splicing, try to use plants that make use of a similar number of genomes
- Use more genomes
- Try to avoid negative colour change values, can lead to strange colours when splicing
- Avoid making direction spread too high
- Splicing keeps genes from each plant randomly, which means you get a different result from splicing every time
- Press "S" to take a screenshot
- You can't save or load while editing
- Splice plants that have already been spliced
- Enter filenames exactly as they are written![image](https://github.com/Wurnace/plant_splicer/assets/122387227/2d19391d-eb8d-4c15-a21f-e169a02487fa)
