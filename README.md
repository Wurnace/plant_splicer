# Plant Splicer
Mix and match plant genetics to create beautiful images!

# Tips
- When splicing, try to use plants that make use of a similar number of genomes
- Use more genomes
- Try to avoid negative colour change values, can lead to strange colours when splicing
- Avoid making direction spread too high
- Splicing keeps genes from each plant randomly, which means you get a different result from splicing every time
- Press "S" to take a screenshot
- You can't save or load while editing
- Splice plants that have already been spliced
